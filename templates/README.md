# SiriLink

SiriLink is a web-based tool for creating and managing custom remote control events on your local network. With SiriLink, users can set up various actions, such as sleep, shutdown, restart, and lock, with an optional password for secure access. The application is designed with a sleek dark theme for ease of use and provides simple controls for creating, editing, and managing events.

## About

SiriLink was inspired by the need for a quick, centralized way to manage computer actions on a local network without direct physical access. Many remote control tools are complex, requiring app installations or complicated setups. SiriLink aims to simplify this process by offering a lightweight, easily customizable interface, perfect for local control of connected devices.

## Features

- **Create Events**: Add custom events to perform actions like sleep, shutdown, restart, or lock.
- **Secure with Passwords**: Add a password to your event URL for extra security.
- **Adjustable Port**: Set the server port globally to configure all URLs dynamically.
- **Clipboard Copy**: Clickable URLs that automatically copy to the clipboard.
- **Responsive Notifications**: Displays copy success notifications with a smooth slide-up animation.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind SiriLink came from a desire to have simple, lightweight, and accessible control over devices in a network without relying on complex or overpowered remote management software. This project blends convenience with control, allowing users to quickly and securely manage events through an intuitive web interface.
